# Functional Data Analysis in Demography
### Contents of the short course "FDA in Demography"

Demographic data (population pyramids, mortality and fertility rates, life expectancy, among other) usually depend on calendar year and/or on age. They can be observed (maybe detailed by sex) for one or several countries (or regions, municipalities, or other geographical divisions). Therefore Functional Data Analysis (FDA) is a perfect framework for describing and modeling demographic data: they can have one or two arguments (calendar year and/or age), they can conform functional time series (when depending on age and having one observation per year for one country) and they can present spatial dependency (regions that are close to each other usually have similar demographic dynamics). 

The outline of this short course is as follows:
1. Definition of basic concepts in Demography.
2. Some demographic data repositories.
3. Three applications of Functional Data Analysis in Demography in Demography:
    1. Mortality rates forecasting.
    2. Clustering population pyramids evolving over time.
    3. Age-specific fertility rates dimensionality reduction.

I will present examples of methodologies, applications and software developed by R. Hyndman and his research group (Hyndman et al. 2013, Hyndman 2019, Hyndman and Shang 2019)
as well as other where I have participated directly (Delicado 2011, Chen et al. 2017).
